I am a second year PhD student supervised by [Jakob Grue Simonsen](http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~simonsen/) and [Rasmus Helles](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6-o19BkAAAAJ&hl=en) at the University of Copenhagen. Currently, I am working on my PhD project "Privacy Lost" and studying the development of web tracking technologies all over the world.
