I am a PhD student in my third year of study, under the supervision of [Jakob Grue Simonsen](http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~simonsen/) and [Rasmus Helles](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6-o19BkAAAAJ&hl=en) at the University of Copenhagen. My research project, titled "Privacy Lost," is currently underway. I am particularly interested in exploring the concepts of Parameter Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) and Structured State Spaces, which represent a revival of RNN. You can find my resume here [resume](./resume/resume.pdf).
